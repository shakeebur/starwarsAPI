# Star Wars API Data Cleanup Script
This is a Javascript script that utilizes the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/api/planets/) to retrieve the name, diameter, gravity, climate, and population for all the planets available on the API. The script then performs data cleanup by removing any planets that have missing or unknown values for all the columns (diameter, gravity, climate, and population), and finally writes the final cleaned dataset to a CSV file.
